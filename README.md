## What is Small Scale Businesses ?
   #### Small businesses surround us. They are on every other street and in every corner. Every second thing someone buys comes from a small business. In India where unemployment is a serious issue, small business gains a special position in the industrial structure because of their ability to utilise labour and create employment.
Small businesses are either services or retail operations like grocery stores, medical stores, tradespeople, bakeries and small manufacturing units. Small businesses are independently owned organisations that require less capital and less workforce and less or no machinery. These businesses are ideally suited to operate on a small scale to serve a local community and to provide profits to the company owners.
Indian government defines small businesses on the basis of the business’s ability to invest in the plant and machinery. According to the definition provided by the government website for business, business.gov.in, a small scale business is a business set up in which the financial commitment towards infrastructure such as building & equipment, whether made as an owner or on rental or purchase basis, does not surpass Rs. 1 crore.

In every economy, small scale businesses are million little parts of the car's engine that keep running but all we see is the four tyres(big corporations)that give the car speed. It is confirmed and we all know that nearly 70% of innovations comes from these small scale businesses only.

## What are the problems faced by Small Scale Industries in India?

  ####  Small Scale Industries do not enjoy much of the advantages enjoyed by large scale enterprises because of their nature and size. Though they have made significant contribution to economic development, they have not realized their full potential. They face many problems in their functioning and many Small Scale Industries are sick.
  The government had reserved certain items for exclusive production by Small Scale Industries. Large scale enterprises were not allowed to produce the items which were reserved for the SSI sector. With the opening up of the economy and following the principles of liberalization and globalization, many items have been successively De-reserved. Therefore Small Scale Industries have to now counter the twin forces of competition from Indian large scale enterprises as well as foreign competitors.
  Following are the problems faced:-
  
    1.Poor capacity utilization
  
    2. Incompetent management & Concentration of industrial units

    3. Inadequate Finance & Inadequate dispersal
