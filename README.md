## What is Small Scale Businesses ?

#### Small businesses surround us. They are on every other street and in every corner. Every second thing someone buys comes from a small business. In India where unemployment is a serious issue, small business gains a special position in the industrial structure because of their ability to utilise labour and create employment.

Small businesses are either services or retail operations like grocery stores, medical stores, tradespeople, bakeries and small manufacturing units. Small businesses are independently owned organisations that require less capital and less workforce and less or no machinery. These businesses are ideally suited to operate on a small scale to serve a local community and to provide profits to the company owners.
Indian government defines small businesses on the basis of the business’s ability to invest in the plant and machinery. According to the definition provided by the government website for business, business.gov.in, a small scale business is a business set up in which the financial commitment towards infrastructure such as building & equipment, whether made as an owner or on rental or purchase basis, does not surpass Rs. 1 crore.

In every economy, small scale businesses are million little parts of the car's engine that keep running but all we see is the four tyres(big corporations)that give the car speed. It is confirmed and we all know that nearly 70% of innovations comes from these small scale businesses only.

## What are the problems faced by Small Scale Industries in India?

#### Small Scale Industries do not enjoy much of the advantages enjoyed by large scale enterprises because of their nature and size. Though they have made significant contribution to economic development, they have not realized their full potential. They face many problems in their functioning and many Small Scale Industries are sick.

The government had reserved certain items for exclusive production by Small Scale Industries. Large scale enterprises were not allowed to produce the items which were reserved for the SSI sector. With the opening up of the economy and following the principles of liberalization and globalization, many items have been successively De-reserved. Therefore Small Scale Industries have to now counter the twin forces of competition from Indian large scale enterprises as well as foreign competitors.
Following are the problems faced:-

    1.Poor capacity utilization

    2. Incompetent management & Concentration of industrial units

    3. Inadequate Finance & Inadequate dispersal

    4. Raw material shortages & Widespread sickness

    5. Lack of marketing support & Government interference

    6. Problem of working capital

    7. Problems in Export &  Strain on government finances

    8. Lack of technology up-gradation

    9. Multiplicity of labor laws

    10. Inability to meet environmental standards

    11. Delayed payments &  Poor industrial relations

# Web Application

- We the Team Terminal Squad decided to come with a solution for urge a small business .
- So for this we decided to built a website which will give a platform for all the shopkeeper whose business is being left behind due to many reasons (recently due to the pandemic).
- Here after succesful registration of Shops via our Android App and after the cross-verification of shops by our Team , we Keep that shop in our platform i.e, Four Corners (Whoose moto is to urge a small business from any corner).

- Customers will come and can buy a variety of products from our shops but before shoping he/she must be register in our website and afterwards they continue their shoping
- As a user buy any product a mail will be sent to that particular project by RPA and this time we are accepting only Cash On Delivery but very soon we wll be coming with various payment gateway.
- After purchasing items he/she redirected to the tracking page where they can track their order

- Now every shopkeeper has a unique id for login in website where that particular can see their order and update customer order process from their side which will be reflected on users side as well by a socket.io (Real time communication).
- All the mails related to this from signup to out for delivery.. will be automatically sent to every customer as well as shopkeeper too for their shop's order.

- This is the total workflow how websites work

- Any suggestion which will enhances our idea is welcome here.

# Robotics Process Automation (RPA)

### What is RPA?

Robotic process automation (RPA) is a software technology that makes it easy to build, deploy, and manage software robots that emulate humans actions interacting with digital systems and software. Just like people, software robots can do things like understand what’s on a screen, complete the right keystrokes, navigate systems, identify and extract data, and perform a wide range of defined actions. We have used SMTP Email Automation Activity to get customers data from the excel sheet.
